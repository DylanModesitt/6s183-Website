              <p>The iPhone was first revealed by Steve Jobs on June 29, 2007 at Macworld in an epic presentation
                  that you should <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnrJzXM7a6o">watch here on YouTube</a>.
                  Please watch the whole 10 minutes, trust me - it's worth it. iPhone's fancy User Interface
                  introduced new modalities of interaction to mobile computing, especially Multitouch. Apple has made
                  iOS one of the most feature-rich and well-supported platforms on the market with their large
                  developer and user communities as well as it's continued support.
              </p>
              <div class="text-center">

                <br>
              <h5>Hardware</h5>
              <p>The iPhone has a capacitive touchscreen that's designed for a bare finger, or multiple fingers for
                  multi-touch sensing. It also contains a ton of sensors, here's a list: </p>
              <ul style="  columns: 2;list-style-position: inside;">
                  <li>Speaker and microphone</li>
                  <li>Multitouch</li>
                  <li>Proximity sensor</li>
                  <li>Ambient light sensor</li>
                  <li>Accelerometer</li>
                  <li>Magnetometer</li>
                  <li>Gyroscopic sensor</li>
                  <li>Radio</li>
                  <li>Fingerprint sensor</li>
                  <li>Barometer</li>
                  <li>3D Touch (Force)</li>
                  <li>Facial recognition sensor</li>
              </ul>
                <p>Each sensor plays a different role in the User Experience, and we'll learn how to read these
                    sensors and how to use the information to make cool apps. iPhone has some pretty impressive
                    computing power under the hood. The newest model, iPhone X, hosts the A11 bionic chip which features
                    a six-core CPU and a three-core GPU that have been optimized for machine learning, AR apps and
                    immersive 3D games. The chip also features a <i>neural engine</i> that can perform
                    up to 600 billion operations per second for rich real-time experiences.
                </p>

              <h5>User Interface</h5>
                <p>iOS is based upon direct manipulation. Interface control elements consist of sliders, switches,
                    buttons and gestures such as swipe, tap, pinch, and reverse pinch. Like all good platforms, iOS
                    has a
                    set of great <a

                    Interface Guidelines</a>. Check them out, and see how the principals both make sense and play
                    into your everyday experience with iOS. No need to read this in it's entirety, as a user a lot of
                these principals will be familiar.
                </p>
              <p>
                    We'll build apps with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit">UIKit</a>, a
                    programming framework that defines common interface elements grouped into three categories:
              </p>
              <ul>
                  <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/bars/navigation-bars/">Bars.</a> Tell people where they are in your app, provide navigation, and may contain
                      buttons or
                             other elements for initiating actions and communicating information.</li>
                  <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/views/action-sheets/">Views.</a> Contain the primary content people see in your app, such as text, graphics,
                      animations, and interactive elements. Views can enable behaviors such as scrolling, insertion, deletion, and arrangement.</li>
                  <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/controls/buttons/">Controls.</a> Initiate actions and convey information. Buttons, switches, text fields, and
                                 progress indicators are examples of controls.</li>

              <h3 id="xcode">Introduction to Xcode
                  <img src="assets/images/xcode.png" height="40px"/></h3>
              <p>Xcode offers a plethora of features including editors, Interface Builder, smart searching, source
                  control, the Assistant Editor, testing, debugging (LLDB), customization and so much more. We'll
                  walk through this complex interface together, and show you how to use various components to build
                  apps. Here is just a quick overview:</p>

              <br><h5>Anatomy of an Xcode Project</h5>
              <p>Creating a new Xcode project is as easy as File → New → Project, and then selecting the appropriate
              starter project. Xcode will automatically create the files you need to start with.</p>
              <p><strong>Project Window</strong><br>
              <div class="text-center">
                  <img src="assets/images/anatomy.png" width="75%">
              </div>
              <br>
              <ol>
                  <li><strong>Navigator.</strong> Primary mechanism for controlling what you see in the main area of
                      the project window. Navigator pane itself can display nine different sets of information
                      represented by the nine icons across its top. You can also filter what you see here with the
                      search feature.</li>
                  <li><strong>Editor.</strong> This is where you get actual work done, reading and writing your
                      code or designing the interface in a Storyboard. When using the <i>Assistant Editor</i>, you
                      'll have a split-screen view of the two files, most often he Storyboard and a corresponding
                      Controller or Class.</li>
                  <li><strong>Utilities.</strong> Contains inspectors that provide information about the current
                      selection or its settings; in some cases, these inspectors let you change those settings.</li>
                  <li><strong>Debugger.</strong> This pane contains information related to lldb and shows the
                      program state when using Breakpoints and contained the console where print and debug
                      statements appear.</li>
              </ol>
              </p>
              <p><strong>Project Files and Dependencies</strong><br>
                  In the figure above, the <span style="font-family: Consolas;">MyFirstiOSApp</span> folder
                  contains the raw code for our project. The Storyboard is our UI, and is on the same level as
                  corresponding View Controllers and classes. Other files, such as Model Classes, will naturally
                  appear in this level. The Info.plist, or information property list, file is a structured text file
                  that contains essential configuration information for our project such as <i>Entitlements</i>.
                  Products by convention holds an
                  automatically generated reference to the
                  built app.</p>
              <p><strong>Target</strong><br>
                  A target is a collection of parts along with rules and settings for how to build a product from
                  them. It is a major determinant of how an app is built. Whenever you build, what you’re really
                  building is a target. In our first app, there is only one target. But there could be more than one
                  target, under certain circumstances. For example, you might want to write an app that can be built
                  as an iPhone app or as an iPad app — two different apps that share a lot of the same code. So you
                  might want one project containing two targets.

              </p>
              <p><strong>Building the Project into an App</strong><br>
                  To build a project is to compile its code and
                  assemble the compiled code, together with various resources, into the actual app. Typically, if
                  you want to know whether your code compiles and your project is consistently and correctly
                  constructed, you’ll build the project (Product → Build). To run a project is to launch the built
                  app, in the Simulator or on a connected device, first select the device in the drop down menu and
                  then run the project (Product → Run -or- the big Play Button &#9654; in the upper
                  left), which automatically builds first if necessary. If your app has errors, it won't be able to
                  build and lldb (debugger) will throw what went wrong in the console.</p>

              <p><a href="https://swift.org/">Swift</a> is a multi-purpose and awesome programming language introduced by Apple in 2014 for
                  iOS and it's other platforms. It works fluently with the large body of existing Objective-C code
                  written for Apple products. Swift is 100% open source, and you can <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift">see the source for yourself
                      here</a>.
                  <br>
                  We'll be using Apple's Official guide to Swift, <a
                          href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language">The Swift Programming Language</a>.

              <h5>Playgrounds</h5>
              <p>Swift Playgrounds are a great way to quickly experiment with Swift and it's features. You can
                  create a new playground in Xcode and see live results of your code on the right hand side. For good
                  measure, here is how you print "Hello, World" to the console:</p>
              <div class="bd-callout bd-callout-info">
                  <div style="background: #ffffff; overflow:auto;width:auto;padding:.2em .6em;"><pre
                          style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%; color: #3F6E74">print(<span
                          style="color: #C41A16">&quot;Hello, world!&quot;</span>)</pre></div>
              </div>

              Let's write some code in the playground to get used to swift!

              <p>Let's jump into iOS development together and learn by doing. Together, we'll
                  build a basic iOS application from scratch and introduce all the tools along the way. We'll go over
                  the
                  following things
                  together:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Creating a Project in Xcode 9</li>
                  <li>Building a UI with Storyboard</li>
                  <li>The iOS Simulator (and uploading to a device)</li>
                  <li>print (outputting to the console using \() notation)</li>
                  <li>Defining a class in Swift, including how to specify instance variables and methods</li>
                  <li>Connecting properties (instance variables) from our Swift code to the UI (outlets)</li>
                  <li>Connecting UI elements to invoke methods in our Swift code (actions)</li>
                  <li>Accessing iOS documentation from our code</li>
                  <li>Optionals (?, unwrapping implicitly by declaring with !, and unwrapping explicitly with ! and
                      if let)</li>
                  <li>Accessibility Labels</li>
              </ul>

              <br><h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
              <p>At the end of each reading we'll recap some main topics that were covered.
                  Here are some key points that we went over in our Intro to Xcode and Swift:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Xcode is used to create native iOS applications and offers many features for a nice
                      development experience</li>
                  <li>Swift is Apple's open source programming languages usd to make iOS apps</li>
              </ul>
