              <h3 id="mvc">Model View Controller</h3>
              <p>We mentioned the design strategy behind iOS apps on the first day - Model-View-Controller. In iOS it
                  becomes very common for developers to put code into a View Controller even when it shouldn't.
                  Beware of Massive View Controllers and make sure you are keeping a good separation of code!
              </p>
              <p>The Model View Controller paradigm:</p>
              <div class="text-center">
                  <img src="assets/images/mvc.png" width="50%">
              </div>
              <br>
              <p><strong>Models.</strong> Where your data resides. Things like persistence, model objects,
                  parsers and networking code normally live there.</p>
              <p><strong>Views.</strong> The face of your app. Its classes are typically reusable, since
                  there aren't any domain-specific logic in them. For example, a <span style="font-family: 'Lucida Console'">UILabel</span> is a
                  view that
                  presents text on the screen, and it’s easily reusable.</p>
              <p><strong>Controllers.</strong> Mediates between the view and the model, typically via the
                  delegation pattern. In the ideal scenario, the controller entity won’t know the concrete
                  view it’s dealing with. Instead, it will communicate with an abstraction via a protocol. A
                  classic example is the way a <span style="font-family: 'Lucida Console'">UITableView</span>
                      communicates with its data source via the <span
                          style="font-family: 'Lucida Console'">UITableViewDataSource</span> protocol.
              </p>

              <p>Simple, right? <a
                      href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Conceptual/CocoaEncyclopedia/Model-View-Controller/Model-View-Controller.html">Apple’s MVC documentation</a> explains these layers in detail and can give
                  you a
                  theoretical understanding that will help you avoid potential pitfalls.</p>

              <br>
              <p>With the View Controller Lifecycle methods we learned about last week, we can draw a "more realistic"
                  Cocoa MVC relationship, that
                  follows the same principles:</p>

                  <strong>Dependency Injection</strong>
                  <p>When creating complex models, where certain classes "depend" on others, always try to pass
                      an instance of the independent class to the dependent class in it's <span style="font-family:

              <h3 id="api">APIs</h3>

              <p>API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a programmatic way to be able to access
                  functions and data of other apps. In terms of Libraries, an API is the functions/methods included
                  in the library. We've already been using Apple's APIs for TableViews. Today pretty much every major
                  platform has an API, most of them are free and you can access them to work with maps and
                  location. APIs allows you to access a
                  huge amount of data and build apps that rely on existing systems like Facebook or Google.</p>

              <p><strong>JavaScript Object Notation</strong>, or <strong>JSON</strong> for short, is a common way to transmit
                  data to
                  and from
                  web
                             services. It’s simple to use and human-readable, which is why it’s so incredibly
                  popular. We'll be working with JSON when dealing with Web APIs. To make HTTP requests to Web APIs
                  that don't have iOS Libraries, we need to make raw GET and POST requests. To do this, one would use
                  <span
                          style="font-family: 'Lucida Console'">URLSession
                  </span> and <span style="font-family: 'Lucida Console'">JSONDecoder</span>.
                  The URLSession grabs the data using an HTTP request and then the JSONDecoder class converts the JSON
                  response into the data type you need (such as String, Int and Objects).</p>

              <h3 id="libs">Using Third Party Libraries</h3>
              <p>Sites like Github are full of Third Party Libraries - chunks of code written by developers like
                  you and me to share with others. Libraries offer quick and easy ways to bring awesome features
                  into your Xcode project. They save you code, time and sanity! There are libraries for various
                  things: everything from UI elements to random color generation to integration with cool Web services.

                  <br>

                  <a href="https://github.com/Wolg/awesome-swift">this list of awesome open-source libraries</a>.
              <br>
              <br>
                  One of my favorite Libraries is <a href="https://developer.affectiva.com/">Affectiva</a> - it classifies emotions based on Facial
                  expression on
                  the device in near real time!

              <h6>Installing Libraries</h6>
              <p>We can install libraries in two ways: 1) drag them into our project after downloading them from the
              Web or 2) use a dependency manager like Cocoapods.</p>

              <p><a href="https://cocoapods.org/">Cocoapods</a> is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa
                  projects. A dependency manager makes it easy to add, remove, update and manage third-party dependencies used by your app.
                  CocoaPods has over 42 thousand libraries and is used in over 3 million apps. The
                  configuration file for Cocoapods is called a "Pod file" - it lists all of the libraries your
                  project depends on and their version numbers.</p>

              <div class="bd-callout bd-callout-danger">
                  <strong>Install Cocoapods</strong>
                  We'll show you how to use Cocoapods in class on Friday, please make sure you have it installed. You
                  can do this with Ruby (which ships with all modern Macs) by running the following lines in terminal:
                    <br>
                  <code>
                      sudo gem install cocoapods<br>
                      pod setup --verbose
                  </code>

              <h3 id="firebase">Firebase <img src="assets/images/firebase.png" width="20px"></h3>
              <p><a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a> is a mobile-backend-as-a-service from Google that
                  provides several features for building
                  powerful
                  mobile apps. Firebase has three core services: a realtime database, user authentication and
                  hosting. With the <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup">Firebase iOS SDK</a>, you can use these services to build powerful apps
                  without
                                               writing a single line of server code.
                <br>
                <br>
                  The realtime database is one of the most unique features of Firebase. When a Firebase database
                  updates, all connected users receive updates in realtime. This means your app can stay up to date without user interaction.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Many of you will be using Firebase as your Cloud Backend for you project and to Authenticate Users
                  (and give them accounts). We'll step through building an app with Firebase in class together!
