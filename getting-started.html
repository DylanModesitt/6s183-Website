              <h3 id="gettingstarted">Getting Started</h3>
              <p> This reading is meant to help you get started with the correct tools and basic knowledge to begin
                  to develop iOS applications in the Swift programming language using Xcode.
              </p>

              <p>Before we begin, you should know that there are a few different ways to build an iOS application:</p>

              <ol>
                  <li>The "Native" way using Apple's tools like Xcode with Objective-C or Swift Programming Languages
                      and the iOS Frameworks and design strategy. These apps can only be deployed on iOS.</li>
                  <li>The "Multi-Platform" way using third-party tools such as PhoneGap/Cordova which allow you to build a Web application and "wrap" it into
                      a native shell for the respecting Mobile OS.</li>
                  <li>Libraries such as React Native which bridge between the native platform and JS, that allows us to
                      render real native component instead of a WebView but use entirely JavaScript to build out
                      our applications.</li>
              </ol>

              <p>In this class, we will focus on the way that Apple intended applications to be built using the awesome
                  tools created and supported by them.</p>

              <br>
              <h3 id="expectations">Expectations</h3>
              <p>This class has lecture MWF 1-3pm in 36-302. It is expected that you come to class everyday (unless
                  you've spoken to an instructor before hand). You will earn 3 units of General Elective Credit for
                  completing this course and will be graded on a P/D/F basis. Each lecture will have a pre-class
                  reading and questions that are expected to be read, thought about and completed before hand.
              </p>
              
              <br>
              <h3 id="prereqs">Prerequisites</h3>
              <p>It is important to know that developing iOS applications can be easy if you have certain knowledge
                  going into it. In this class we will assume that you know/have experience with:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Object-Oriented Programming (Python (using Classes), Java, C++. etc.)</li>
                  <li>Have used an iOS app</li>
              </ul>


              <br>
              <h3 id="tools">Tools</h3>
              <p>To develop iOS apps using the latest technologies in this class, you need a Mac computer (macOS
                  10.11.5 or later) running the latest version of Xcode (currently version 9.2.x). Xcode includes all
                  the features you need to design, develop, and debug an app. Unlike other platforms, like the Web,
                  there is little flexibility for the programming, construction, and deployment of native
                  applications on iOS. However, the good thing is that Apple's IDE, Xcode, is an excellent developer
                  experience (for the most part). It also contains the iOS SDK, which extends Xcode to include the
                  tools, compilers, and frameworks you need specifically for iOS development. We'll jump into what
                  these components are in a bit, let's first get you set up with all of the tools so you can start
                  creating iOS apps on Day 1!

                  <br>
                  <br>

                  <strong><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12">Download</a> the latest
                  version of Xcode on your Mac free from the App Store.</strong>

                  <br>
                  <br>

                  Some of you may already have Xcode installed, in that case make sure you have the latest version
                  installed.

              </p>

              <p>Apple provides iPhone/iPad Simulators to run our apps on our computer screen and view them just as
                  they would appear on an actual device. However, if you have an iOS device (not required), you can
                  upload your apps to it and try them out in the palm of your hand!</p>
