              <p>We introduced a lot of features in Swift to you in lecture 1. We encourage you to mess around in a
                  Playground and continue to learn more. The better you are at Swift, the quicker it will be to build
                  iOS apps!

                  <p>In class we introduced you to concepts from <a
                          href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html">The Basics</a> all the way to  <a

              <h5>Protocols</h5>
              <p>A protocol defines a blueprint of methods, properties, and other requirements that suit a particular
                  task or piece of functionality. The protocol can then be adopted by a class, structure, or
                  enumeration to provide an actual implementation of those requirements. Any type that satisfies the
                  requirements of a protocol is said to conform to that protocol.</p>

              <h6>Building Interfaces</h6>
              <p>We'll be creating UIs as Storyboards with Interface Builder in Xcode. As we saw
                  in the first class, this
                  allows us to drag and drop various UI components onto the screen to visually build our UI.
                  AutoLayout helps us ensure that our UI fits on all iOS devices of varying screen size. We
                  could do this programmatically - and some of you my prefer that. If you wanna see how that's done,
                  <a href="https://medium.com/@danstepanov/your-first-ios-app-100-programmatically-xcode-7-2-swift-2-1-9946d09610c4">check out this article.</a>
              </p>

              <br>
              <h6>Views</h6>
              <p>The UIView class defines a rectangular area on the screen on which it shows content. It handles the
                  rendering of any content in its area and also any interactions with that content – touches and
                  gestures. Your code can do some or all of the view’s drawing of itself; it can make the view appear
                  and disappear, move, resize itself, and display many other physical changes, possibly with animation.

                      <li>Views are the fundamental building blocks of your app's user interface</li>
                      <li>The coordinate system for a view starts from the upper left</li>
                      <li>Views are used for custom drawing and animation and can handle events such as touches or
                          gestures</li>
                      <li>Views may contain zero or more subviews and their size/position/orientation can be
                          changed by you programmatically or through AutoLayout</li>
                      <li><a href="https://www.weheartswift.com/uiview-fundamentals/">Here is a great tutorial</a> to learn more about UIView</li>

              </div>
              <p>
                  The view hierarchy is the chief mode of view organization. A view can have subviews; a subview has exactly one immediate superview. Thus there is a tree of views. This hierarchy allows views to come and go together. If a view is removed from the interface, its subviews are removed; if a view is hidden (made invisible), its subviews are hidden; if a view is moved, its subviews move with it; and other changes in a view are likewise shared with its subviews.
              </p>
              <h6>View Controllers</h6>
              <p>
                  Management of the view resides in a view controller, an instance of UIViewController.
                  Actually, a view controller is most likely to be an instance of a UIViewController subclass. The UIViewController class is designed to be subclassed. You are very unlikely to use a plain vanilla UIViewController object. You might write your own UIViewController subclass; you might use a built-in UIViewController subclass such as UINavigationController or UITabBarController; or you might subclass a built-in UIViewController subclass such as UITableViewController
              </p>
              <br>
              <h6>View Controller Life Cycle</h6>
              <p>The View has a "Life Cycle" - different moments in time that correspond to certain actions. All
                  these commands are called automatically at the appropriate times by iOS when you load/present/hide
                  the view controller. It's important to note that these methods are attached to
                  <span style="font-family: 'Lucida Console';">UIViewController</span> and
                  not to <span style="font-family: 'Lucida Console';">UIViews</span> themselves. You won't get any of these
                  features just using a <span style="font-family: 'Lucida Console';">UIView</span>. </p>
              <p>You can <a href="">check out Apple's official documentation here</a>. But here is a brief overview:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>ViewDidLoad.</strong> Called when you create the class and load from xib. Great for
                      initial
                      setup and
                      one-time-only work.</li>

                  <li><strong>ViewWillAppear.</strong> Called right before your view appears, good for hiding/showing fields
                      or any
                  operations that you want to happen every time before the view is visible. Because you might be
                      going back and forth between views, this will be called every time your view is about to appear
                      on the screen.</li>

                  <li><strong>ViewDidAppear.</strong> Called after the view appears - great place to start an animations or
                      the loading
                      of external data from an API.</li>

                  <li><strong>ViewWillDisappear/DidDisappear.</strong> Same idea as ViewWillAppear/ViewDidAppear.</li>

                  <li>ViewDidUnload/ViewDidDispose - In Objective C, this is where you do your clean-up and
                  release of stuff, but this is handled automatically so not much you really need to do here.</li>
              </ul>

              <h3 id="table">Table and Collection Views</h3>
              <p>Displaying sets of data is a rather common task in building a mobile app. Apple’s SDK provides two
                  components to help carry out such a task without having to implement everything from scratch: A
                  table view (UITableView) and a collection view (UICollectionView).Table views and collection views
                  are both designed to support displaying sets of data that can be scrolled. </p>
