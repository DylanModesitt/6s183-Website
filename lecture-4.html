              <p>We mentioned the design strategy behind iOS apps on the first day - Model-View-Controller. In iOS it
                  becomes very common for developers to put code into a View Controller even when it shouldn't.
                  Beware of Massive View Controllers and make sure you are keeping a good separation of code!

              <p>API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a programmatic way to be able to access
                  functions and data of other apps. In terms of Libraries, an API is the functions/methods included
                  in the library. We've already been using Apple's APIs for TableViews. Today pretty much every major
                  platform has an API, most of them are free and you can access them to work with maps and
                  location. APIs allows you to access a
                  huge amount of data and build apps that rely on existing systems like Facebook or Google.</p>

              <p><a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a> is a mobile-backend-as-a-service from Google that
                  provides several features for building
                  powerful
                  mobile apps. Firebase has three core services: a realtime database, user authentication and
                  hosting. With the <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup">Firebase iOS SDK</a>, you can use these services to build powerful apps
                  without
                  writing a single line of server code.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The realtime database is one of the most unique features of Firebase. When a Firebase database
                  updates, all connected users receive updates in realtime. This means your app can stay up to date without user interaction.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Many of you will be using Firebase as your Cloud Backend for you project and to Authenticate Users
                  (and give them accounts). We'll step through building an app with Firebase in class together!

              <p>We can install libraries in two ways: 1) drag them into our project after downloading them from the
              Web or 2) use a dependency manager like Cocoapods.</p>

              <p><a href="https://cocoapods.org/">Cocoapods</a> is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa
                  projects. A dependency manager makes it easy to add, remove, update and manage third-party dependencies used by your app.
                  CocoaPods has over 42 thousand libraries and is used in over 3 million apps. The
                  configuration file for Cocoapods is called a "Pod file" - it lists all of the libraries your
                  project depends on and their version numbers.</p>

                  <strong>Install Cocoapods</strong>
                  We'll show you how to use Cocoapods in class on Friday, please make sure you have it installed. You
                  can do this with Ruby (which ships with all modern Macs) by running the following lines in terminal:
                    <br>
                  <code>
                      sudo gem install cocoapods<br>
