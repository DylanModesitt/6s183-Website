              <h3 id="images">Images</h3>
              <p>The basic general UIKit image class is <code>UIImage</code>. UIImage can read a file from disk, so if an
                  image
                  does not need to be created dynamically, but has already been created before your app runs, then
                  drawing may be as simple as providing an image file as a resource in your app’s bundle. The system
                  knows how to work with many standard image file types, such as TIFF, JPEG, GIF, and PNG. You can
                  also  obtain image data in some other way, such as by downloading it, and transform this into a
                  UIImage. Conversely, you can draw your own image for display in your interface or for saving to
                  disk. Many built-in Cocoa interface objects will accept a UIImage as part of how they draw themselves; for example, a UIButton can display an image, and a UINavigationBar or a UITabBar can have a background image.
              </p>
              <p>In the very simplest case, an image file in your app’s bundle can be obtained through the
                  UIImage class method <code>imageNamed:</code>. This method looks at the top level of your app’s bundle
                      for an
                  image file with the supplied name, including the file extension, and reads it as a <code>UIImage</code>
                  instance.  A nice thing about this approach is that memory management is handled for you: the
                  image data may be cached in memory, and if you ask for the same image by calling <code>imageNamed:</code>
                      again
                  later, the cached data may be supplied immediately. You can also read an image file from anywhere
                  in  your app’s bundle using the class method <code>imageWithContentsOfFile:</code> or the instance method
                  <code>initWithContentsOfFile:</code>, both of which expect a pathname string; you can get a reference to
                  your app’s bundle with <code>NSBundle.mainBundle()</code>, and NSBundle then provides instance
                      methods for
                  getting the pathname of a file within the bundle, such as <code>pathForResource:ofType:</code>.</p>

              <div class="bd-callout bd-callout-info">
                  <strong>PNG images preferred</strong>
                  <p>In iOS development, PNG is favored because of the multiple formatting and optional editing. Most
                      importantly, PNG is a loss-less compression format, that means it compresses images without
                      losing any quality. In addition, PNG supports transparency, while others such as JPG do not.</p>
              </div>

              <p>
                  A <code>UIImageView</code> is a <code>UIView</code>, so it can have a background color in addition
                  to its
                  image, it can
                                     have an alpha (transparency) value, and so forth. A UIImageView without a background color is invisible except for its image, so the image simply appears in the interface, without the user being aware that it resides in a rectangular host. An image may have areas that are transparent, and a UIImageView will respect this; thus an image of any shape can appear. A UIImageView without an image and without a background color is invisible, so you could start with an empty UIImageView in the place where you will later need an image and subsequently assign the image in code. You can assign a new image to substitute one image for another.

              <p><code>MapKit</code> is a really useful API available on iOS devices that makes it easy to display maps,
                  plot
                         locations, and even draw routes and other shapes on top.</p>
